    "* OOP is a way to structure our code that we'll be able to be organized as it gets bigger.\n",
    "  * With OOP we  save lots of lines of code in order to clean organized efficient programming.\n",
    "  * OOP allows us to crate objects that have their own methods and attributes (properties).\n",
    "    * Attributes are pieces of data that are dynamic and their going to be unique to that specific object.\n",
    "    * Class object attributes are not dynamic. It can not be modify to every object instantiated.\n",
    "    * There are class methods and static methods. @classmethod & @staticmethod.\n",

    "* 4 Pillars of oop:\n",
    "  1. Encapsulation: Binding of functions and data that manipulate that data.\n",
    "  2. Abstraction: Hiding of information and give access to what is necessary.\n",
    "      * Private vs Public variables: In python there isn't actual private variable but just a naming convention: _variable\n",
    "      * In fact dunder method is kind of a naming convention to warn others that this shouldn't over write.\n",
    "  3. Inheritance: Allows new objects to take on the properties of existing objects. isinstance(instance, class)\n",
    "  4. Polymorphism: Object classes can share same method name but it can act differently based on what object calls them.\n",
    "      * Like archers and wizards that both have attack method.\n",
    "* Dunder methods are special methods that python allows us to use with our objects.\n",
    "  * Every thing in python is an object that inherits from the base object class.\n",
    "* MRO is a rule to determine when U run a method which one to run when there is complicated inheritance structure. D.mro()\n",
    "  * We should avoid multi inheritance as much as possible or at least be cautious when dealing with it."
